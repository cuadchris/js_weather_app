A simple weather app that will suggest cities based on what you've entered after a delay of 1s in between inputs. This is for debouncing/throttling purposes.
P.S. The suggested cities are cities with a population of at least 350k. Tried to narrow it down a bit. You can still enter any city you can think of.
